              <p >We are number one in the world of burgers In 1954, James McLamore and David Edgerton opened their first BURGER KING® restaurant in Miami, FloridaThe great success of the early restaurants made the BURGER KING® concept a natural for selling franchises. The concept spread rapidly throughout the 1960s and in 1963 the first international franchise restaurants opened in Puerto Rico.
